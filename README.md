## Description

This project is about converting a static landing page with no interactivities to  
an interactive page that has a dynamically-built navigation experience.

## Usage

This project consists of three files:  
* `index.html` which has the static structure
* `css/styles.css` which adds styles to the page
* `js/app.js` which is our main event

*`js/app.js`* adds the whole application navigation functionality. It builds the navigation   
bar dynamically depending on the sections of the page.

Each navigation bar anchor refers to a corresponding section, so by clicking on it,  
this scrolls to the desired section to be visible on the viewport.

Also, when scrolling to some section, it becomes highlighted, and the corresponding  
navigation anchor becomes highlighted too.

## Dependencies

This project has been built on **JavaScript** Version: *ES2015/ES6* and has no dependencies.
